# https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-finishing-order/
#You are given an integer array order of length n and an integer array friends.

# - order contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, representing the IDs of the participants of a race in their finishing order.
# - friends contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly increasing order. Each ID in friends is guaranteed to appear in the order array.
# Return an array containing your friends' IDs in their finishing order.

            if i in friends:
                f.append(i)
        return f
